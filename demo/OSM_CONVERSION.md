# OpenStreetMap PBF to CSV

The repository includes `scripts/osm_pbf_to_csv.py`, a streaming converter for
OpenStreetMap PBF extracts. It exports tagged, map-ready features (POIs, roads,
buildings, parks, land use, natural features, transit, routes, and boundaries)
while skipping untagged support nodes. Ways include GeoJSON geometry and a
representative map coordinate; relation rows retain their tags and member count
but do not attempt to assemble multipolygon geometry.

The converter uses a temporary disk-backed location index, so it does not load
the whole PBF into Python memory. Raw PBFs and `data/output/` are intentionally
gitignored. The small example in `data/samples/` shows the output format.

From the repository root on macOS/Linux:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python scripts/osm_pbf_to_csv.py \
  ~/Downloads/new-york-260920.osm.pbf \
  data/output/osm/new-york-260920-osm-features.csv \
  --sample-output data/samples/osm_features_sample.csv \
  --overwrite
```

Run `python scripts/osm_pbf_to_csv.py --help` for all options. The
`geometry_geojson` cell is valid GeoJSON and `tags_json` preserves the complete
OSM tag dictionary for later MongoDB imports.

This command runs from the repository root. See [the project README](../README.md)
for the standard dashboard setup.
